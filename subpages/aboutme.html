    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>Greetings! I'm <span class="highlight">Param Chhabra</span>, a native of <span class="highlight">Jaipur, Rajasthan</span>, born on <span class="highlight">March 9, 2004</span>. My educational journey began at <span class="highlight">Jayshree Periwal High School</span>, where I laid the groundwork for my academic pursuits. My dedication and hard work manifested in a commendable <span class="highlight">94.5%</span> in my 12th-grade examinations, propelling me into the next phase of my education.</p>
    <p>Currently in my <span class="highlight">fourth semester</span> at the <span class="highlight">Vellore Institute of Technology</span>, I am delighted to share that my academic journey is marked by a consistently high <span class="highlight">CGPA of 9.34</span>. This ongoing semester serves as a testament to my commitment to <span class="highlight">academic excellence</span> and <span class="highlight">continuous learning</span>.</p>

    <p>Immersed in the realm of <span class="highlight">Computer Science</span>, my passion for <span class="highlight">coding</span> and <span class="highlight">technology</span> has been the driving force behind my academic endeavors. While <span class="highlight">professional experience</span> is yet to be fully realized, my enthusiasm to delve into the world of <span class="highlight">coding</span> and <span class="highlight">technology</span> remains unwavering, motivating me to constantly explore new horizons and expand my <span class="highlight">skill set</span>.</p> <p>This academic journey is not merely about acquiring knowledge but embracing a mindset of <span class="highlight">perpetual curiosity</span> and 
        <span class="highlight">resilience</span> to overcome challenges. Join me as I navigate through the complexities of <span class="highlight">algorithms</span>, the diversity of <span class="highlight">programming languages</span>, and the ever-evolving landscape of <span class="highlight">innovative technologies</span>. Stay tuned for updates, breakthroughs, and reflections on my expanding journey in the <span class="highlight">tech world</span>.</p> <p>Beyond technology, I am deeply passionate about collaborative initiatives that contribute to <span class="highlight">positive societal change</span>. By harnessing the power of <span class="highlight">
            technology</span> and <span class="highlight">community engagement</span>, I aspire to be a part of projects that address real-world challenges and foster <span class="highlight">meaningful impact</span>. Uptill now, I do not have any <span class="highlight">professional experience</span> but I have taken part in <span class="highlight">2 hackathons</span> and have cleared a few levels in each. I have collaborated in clubs like 
        <span class="highlight">IEEE</span> and <span class="highlight">IET</span> in my college through which I got to know various seniors and professors.</p> <p>Together, let's embark on this exciting adventure, embracing the myriad opportunities that lie ahead in the world of <span class="highlight">technology</span> and beyond. Through this journey, I am committed to not only shaping my narrative but also contributing to the larger narrative of <span class="highlight">positive change</span> in our interconnected world.
